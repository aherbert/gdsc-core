/**
 * Applies to generators of random number sequences that follow a uniform distribution and can be
 * split to create a new independent instance.
 *
 * <h2>Overlap Computations</h2>
 *
 * <p>The probability of overlap among different streams of generators can be computed using an
 * approximation. The following is extracted from L&#39;Ecuyer, et al. (2017).
 *
 * <p>If the RNG has period {@code p} and we take {@code s} different streams of length {@code l},
 * with random starting points in the sequence, and assuming that {@code sl/p} is very small, the
 * probability that there is some overlap is approximately {@code s}<sup>2</sup>{@code l/p}.
 *
 * <p>For example if {@code s=l=}2<sup>20</sup> the overlap probability 2<sup>60</sup>{@code /p} is
 * near 2<sup>-68</sup> for {@code p=}2<sup>128</sup> and near 2<sup>-964</sup> for
 * {@code p=}2<sup>1024</sup>.
