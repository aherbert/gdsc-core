/**
 * A blocking queue that can be closed.
 *
 * <p>This is a simplified implementation of a queue backed by array storage. It is not intended as
 * a replacement for {@link java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue} and it does not implement the
 * {@link Collection} interface.
 *
 * <p>The queue supports put and take of non-null items. These actions will block until the queue
 * has space to allow put or has items to allow take.
 *
 * <p>Modifications have been made to allow the queue to be closed to puts. When closed the
 * behaviour is non-blocking. Any blocked threads waiting to put or take are released. No puts to
 * the queue are allowed and any take operations return items or null when the queue is empty. The
 * transition to closed is not reversible.
 *
 * <p>A pipeline to process items can be created using producer and consumer threads. If the queue
 * is closed all threads will unblock. The producer should respond to the boolean flag returned by
 * put indicating if the item was added to the queue. If the false then the producer can accept this
 * as a shutdown signal. The consumer should check taken items are not null. If null then the
 * consumer can accept this as a shutdown signal.
 *
 * @param <E> the element type
 * @see ConcurrentMonoStack
