/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving image events. The methods in this class are empty. This
 * class exists as a convenience for creating listener objects.
 *
 * <p>Extend this class to create an <code>ImagePlus</code> listener and override the methods for
 * the events of interest. (If you implement the <code>ImageListener</code> interface, you have to
 * define all of the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them all, so you
 * only have to define methods for events you care about.)
 *
 * <p>Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it using
 * {@link ImagePlus#addImageListener(ImageListener)}.
